# Init system options
#
#
# Define default options for autofs.
#
# MASTER_MAP_NAME - default map name for the master map.
#
MASTER_MAP_NAME="/etc/auto.master"
#
# TIMEOUT - set the default mount timeout (default 600).
#
TIMEOUT=<%= @mounttimeout %>
#
# NEGATIVE_TIMEOUT - set the default negative timeout for
#          failed mount attempts (default 60).
#
#NEGATIVE_TIMEOUT=60
#
# MOUNT_WAIT - time to wait for a response from umount(8).
#          Setting this timeout can cause problems when
#          mount would otherwise wait for a server that
#          is temporarily unavailable, such as when it's
#          restarting. The defailt of waiting for mount(8)
#          usually results in a wait of around 3 minutes.
#
#MOUNT_WAIT=-1
#
# UMOUNT_WAIT - time to wait for a response from umount(8).
#
#UMOUNT_WAIT=12
#
# BROWSE_MODE - maps are browsable by default.
#
BROWSE_MODE=<%= @browsable %>
#
# MOUNT_NFS_DEFAULT_PROTOCOL - specify the default protocol used by
#              mount.nfs(8). Since we can't identify
#              the default automatically we need to
#              set it in our configuration. This will
#              only make a difference for replicated
#              map entries as availability probing isn't
#              used for single host map entries.
#
#MOUNT_NFS_DEFAULT_PROTOCOL=3
#
# APPEND_OPTIONS - append to global options instead of replace.
#
#APPEND_OPTIONS="yes"
#
# LOGGING - set default log level "none", "verbose" or "debug"
#
#LOGGING="none"
#
# If the kernel supports using the autofs miscellanous device
# and you wish to use it you must set this configuration option
# to "yes" otherwise it will not be used.

# Use OPTIONS to add automount(8) command line options that
# will be used when the daemon is started.
